## Concept
A simple iOS app capable of receving the total value of a bill, the tip percentage, the amount of people splitting the bill, and returning the value that each one has to pay.

## Stack
My current goal is to revisit the basics of iOS development, creating a strong foundation on Swift, SwiftUI, and UIKit. With every subject that I've studied throughout my life, be it tech related or not, one premisse 
has remained true: **a strong foundations is the most important part when learning something new**. For this reason, I'm revisitind the basics of iOS development and decided to use **SwiftUI**.

## How to run
If you would like to run this on your computer and try it for yourself, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open this project on XCode.
3. Run the app on the simulator or on your own iPhone.
4. Fill the empty inputs.
5. Watch as the app tells you how much you should pay :)
